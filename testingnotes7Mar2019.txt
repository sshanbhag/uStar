Diagnostics:

1) playwav.m as delivered from Microstar:

no output. code is incorrect: output data should be recdata, not samples

data need to be properly scaled to +/- 32767; playwav doesn't do this.

length of playwav.wav is longer than the 5 seconds of data (at 10kHz
output rate) that playwav.dap and playwav.m are expecting

fixed these issues, output looks ok.
